ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)
               
The error message you're seeing indicates that the MySQL client cannot establish a connection to the MySQL server through the specified socket. There are a few common reasons for this error, and here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check if MySQL Server is Running:
Ensure that the MySQL server is running. You can do this by checking the status of the MySQL service:

           
           
sudo service mysql status
If it's not running, you can start it with:

           
           
sudo service mysql start
Verify MySQL Socket Path:
Check if the socket file /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock exists. If it doesn't, it could mean that MySQL is not running, or the socket file is located elsewhere.

Update MySQL Socket Configuration:
The MySQL configuration file (my.cnf or my.ini) may specify a different socket path. Locate the configuration file and update the socket parameter if necessary. Common locations for the MySQL configuration file include /etc/my.cnf, /etc/mysql/my.cnf, or /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf.

Check MySQL Error Log:
Examine the MySQL error log for any issues or error messages that might provide more information about the problem. The error log is typically located in the MySQL data directory, and the file is usually named error.log.

Firewall Issues:
Ensure that your firewall is not blocking the MySQL port (default is 3306). If you are running a firewall, you may need to allow incoming connections on the MySQL port.

MySQL Server Restart:
Try restarting the MySQL server to apply any changes you've made to the configuration.

           
           
sudo service mysql restart
Permissions on Socket File:
Ensure that the MySQL server has the necessary permissions to create and access the socket file. The user running the MySQL server should have sufficient privileges.

Reinstall MySQL Client:
In some cases, there may be an issue with the MySQL client installation. Try reinstalling the MySQL client package.

           
           
sudo apt-get remove mysql-client
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
After performing these steps, try connecting to MySQL again. If the issue persists, carefully review any error messages and consult the MySQL documentation or community forums for further assistance.

How to you add a new record in the table users?

+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Table | Create Table                                                                                                                  |
+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| users | CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `id` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `name` varchar(256) DEFAULT NULL,
  `age` int(11) DEFAULT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 |
+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (2, “Betty”, 30);


INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (2, “Betty”, 30);


INSERT users (id, name, age) VALUES (2, “Betty”, 30);


INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (2, “Betty”);
               
The correct syntax for adding a new record to the "users" table would be:

sql
           
INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (2, 'Betty', 30);
In this case, the statement includes the column names (id, name, and age) and the corresponding values for the new record. Additionally, make sure to use single quotes (') for string values, as shown in the example.

+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

SELECT * FROM users WHERE age IS UP TO 21;


SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 21;


SELECT * FROM users WHERE age < 21;


SELECT * FROM users WHERE age BETWEEN 21 AND 89;
               
The correct SQL query to list all user records with an age greater than 21 is:

sql
           
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 21;
This query selects all columns (*) from the "users" table where the value in the "age" column is greater than 21. The comparison operator > is used to filter the records based on the specified condition.

What is a relational database? (please select all correct answers)


a table containing only one object representation


a collection of data


a database


data are organized by tables, records and columns


a table containing multiple object representation

The correct answers are:

a collection of data
a database
data are organized by tables, records, and columns
data are organized by tables and indexes
A relational database is a collection of data organized in a structured way. In a relational database, data is typically organized into tables, where each table consists of rows (records) and columns. Relationships between tables are established using keys. Indexes are often used to improve the performance of queries. The options mentioning a single object representation, multiple object representation, or married databases are not accurate descriptions of a relational database.

+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

SELECT * FROM users;


SELECT ALL users;


DELETE * FROM users;
               
The correct SQL query to list all users in the "users" table is:

sql
           
SELECT * FROM users;
This query selects all columns (*) from the "users" table, effectively retrieving all records from that table. The other options, SELECT ALL users; and DELETE * FROM users;, are not valid syntax for listing all records. The correct syntax for selecting all records is SELECT * FROM table_name;.

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 89;


DELETE FROM users;


DELETE users WHERE id = 89;


DELETE FROM users WHERE id IS EQUAL TO 89;
               
The correct SQL query to delete the user record with id equal to 89 in the "users" table is:

sql
           
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 89;
This query deletes the record where the value in the "id" column is equal to 89. The correct syntax uses the DELETE FROM statement followed by the table name and a WHERE clause to specify the condition for deletion.

The other options DELETE FROM users; and DELETE users WHERE id = 89; are not specific enough and may result in deleting all records from the table. The syntax DELETE FROM users WHERE id IS EQUAL TO 89; is not valid; the correct comparison operator is simply =.

CHANGE users SET name = “Holberton” WHERE id = 89;


UPDATE users SET name = “Holberton”;


UPDATE users SET name = “Holberton” WHERE id = 89;
               
The correct SQL query to change the name of the user record with id equal to 89 to "Holberton" in the "users" table is:

sql
           
UPDATE users SET name = 'Holberton' WHERE id = 89;
This query uses the UPDATE statement to modify the data in the "users" table. It sets the value of the "name" column to 'Holberton' for the record where the value in the "id" column is equal to 89. Note that string values should be enclosed in single quotes.

The option CHANGE users SET name = “Holberton” WHERE id = 89; is not valid SQL syntax for updating records. The correct syntax uses UPDATE as shown above.

CHANGE users SET name = “Holberton” WHERE id = 89;


UPDATE users SET name = “Holberton”;


UPDATE users SET name = “Holberton” WHERE id = 89;
               
The correct SQL query to change the name of the user record with id equal to 89 to "Holberton" in the "users" table is:

sql
           
UPDATE users SET name = 'Holberton' WHERE id = 89;
This query uses the UPDATE statement to modify the data in the "users" table. It sets the value of the "name" column to 'Holberton' for the record where the value in the "id" column is equal to 89. Note that string values should be enclosed in single quotes.

So, the correct option is:

sql
           
UPDATE users SET name = 'Holberton' WHERE id = 89;
